# 🤖 Groq-Powered RAG Chatbot

A high-performance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot built with **LangChain 0.3** and **Groq**. This bot retrieves context from a local `data.txt` file to provide accurate, grounded answers to user queries.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Ultrafast Inference:** Uses Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) for near-instant responses.
* **Modern LCEL:** Built using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for improved reliability over deprecated `langchain.chains` modules.
* **Local Vector Intelligence:** Uses `ChromaDB` and `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` to process and search your data locally.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

First, clone the repository and navigate to your project folder.

**Create a Virtual Environment:**
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts.

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

```

**Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip -r requirements.txt

```

### 2. Get Your API Key

1. Go to the [Groq Cloud Console](https://console.groq.com/).
2. Navigate to **API Keys** and click **Create API Key**.
3. Copy the key immediately.

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and paste your key:

```text
GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here

```

## 📂 Data Preparation

The bot answers questions based on a file named `data.txt`.

1. Create a `data.txt` file in the main folder.
2. Paste any text data you want the chatbot to "know."
3. The bot will automatically chunk this text and create a local vector database in the `/db` folder upon the first run.

## 🏃 How to Run

Simply execute the script:

```bash
python sample_chatbot.py

```

Type `exit` or `quit` to end the session.

## 🧠 Why this Architecture?

* **VectorStore Search:** Instead of sending the whole document to the AI (which is expensive and slow), we only send the top 3 most relevant snippets.
* **LCEL Pipeline:** We replaced the legacy `RetrievalQA` black-box with a transparent pipeline (`retriever | prompt | llm`). This prevents the `ModuleNotFoundError` common in newer LangChain versions.
* **Groq vs. OpenAI:** Groq provides a generous free tier for developers with speeds that far exceed standard API endpoints.

## 🧪 5 Sample Queries to Test

* *"I have an issue with my hardware."*
* *"What can I do to make my system last long?"*
* *"What are the main categories of issues mentioned in the document?"*
* *"Summarize the maintenance practices suggested."*
* *"Based on the context, how should I start troubleshooting?"*

### Pro-Tip

If you change the content of `data.txt`, you may want to delete the `chroma_db` folder to force the chatbot to re-index your new information.
