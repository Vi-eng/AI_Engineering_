### 1. Hardware Problems

Hardware problems occur when a physical component of the computer is damaged, improperly connected, or failing.

**Common symptoms:**

* PC does not power on
* Beeping sounds during startup
* Overheating
* Random shutdowns
* External devices not detected

**Solutions:**

* Check power cables, adapters, and wall sockets to ensure proper power supply.
* Reseat internal components such as RAM, graphics cards, and storage drives.
* Clean dust from fans, vents, and heat sinks to prevent overheating.
* Replace faulty hardware components if diagnostics confirm failure.
* Test peripherals (keyboard, mouse, USB drives) on another system.
